# Sri Lanka Explorer Project

This is a ReactJS web application built with Vite that showcases Sri Lanka's provinces, districts, and major cities. The project uses:

- **React** with React Router for navigation
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom color scheme:
  - #000000 (black)
  - #14213d (navy-blue)
  - #fca311 (accent-gold)
  - #e5e5e5 (light-gray)
  - #ffffff (white)

## Project Structure

- `/src/components/` - React components (Navigation, Footer, Provinces, Districts, Cities)
- `/src/data/` - Sri Lanka geographical data
- Tailwind configured with custom colors in `tailwind.config.js`

## Navigation Flow

1. Provinces page (home) - displays all 9 provinces
2. Districts page - shows districts within a selected province
3. Cities page - lists all cities within a selected district

Please maintain the existing color scheme and responsive design patterns when making suggestions or modifications.
