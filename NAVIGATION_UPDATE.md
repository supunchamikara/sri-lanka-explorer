# Navigation Update: Public Experience Link

## Changes Made

### ✅ Added "Experiences" Link to Main Navigation

- **Location**: Top navigation bar, visible to all users (authenticated and unauthenticated)
- **Position**: Between "Provinces" and user menu/login button
- **Functionality**: Allows anyone to access `/experience` page directly

### ✅ Updated Authenticated User Dropdown

- **Removed**: "Experience" link from dropdown (now redundant)
- **Kept**: "Add Experience" and "Profile" links in dropdown
- **Updated**: Active state styling to only highlight dropdown for add/edit/profile pages

### ✅ Enhanced Search Functionality

- **Updated**: Search suggestions now load for all users (not just authenticated)
- **Improved**: Unauthenticated users can now search experiences using the navbar search

## Navigation Structure

### For Unauthenticated Users

```
[Home] [Provinces] [Experiences] [Login / Register]
```

### For Authenticated Users

```
[Home] [Provinces] [Experiences] [Welcome, UserName ▼]
                                      └─ Add Experience
                                      └─ Profile
                                      └─ Logout
```
